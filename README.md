# Digital-FLL
Developed a digital Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) for single-phase and three-phase systems using an SOGI pre-filter, zero crossing detector and a novel counter-based algorithm.
ntroduced abnormal grid conditions at 0.45 seconds, including voltage sag, phase jumps, frequency drift, DC offset, and
harmonics, to achieve rapid and accurate frequency and phase estimation.
